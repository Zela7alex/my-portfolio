# Portfolio

## Description
This project is a portfolio page made to showcase my most recent work as well as being a way to contact me for any future projects or collaberations. 
This website was made entirely with html and css, with various sections separating the contents of page. Flexbox and grid were the main properties used to move elements in this website. I incorporated a color scheme of my favorite colors as well as section-title backround images of my favorite things in nature, sunsets. As well, the icons on the homepage lead to my social media and the portfolio images lead to the deployed gitpages URL. Have a nice day! :)
